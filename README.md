### Description

Flying Windows claims fully back the valuable work area of your IDE! No unneeded tool or property

window is open when writing code or designing a form. Now the whole screen belongs to you to design

your form or write some code! And when you need a tool/property window: One quick move (no mouseclick!)

of your mouse is enough to get it back / take it away.

___ 2nd hilite: Small property windows for controls like the known tooltips are assisting your form design!

___ And some more nice gimmicks...



----

Advertisement stop. ;) - To the facts:

Implemented in Flying Windows so far

* Hotcorners for most used tool windows (toolbox, properties, project

explorer and immediate window)

* Empty the immediate window when ctrl key is pressed on opening by hotcorner.

* Tooltip windows for controls showing the name and the most important properties.

* Click on a property value in the tooltip window with ctrl key pressed puts this

value into the clipboard.

* Tooltip windows are moveable by caption bar. Leave them open with ctrl key pressed

when mouse leaves tooltip window. Close them with a simple mouseclick.

* Show mouse pointers absolut screen coordinates in VB IDEs title bar in pixel.

* With an open source code pane moving the mouse to the left border of the screen

opens the coresponding designer window (Shift-F7) and reverse.

* The size of comboboxes of a code pane are increased to show much more values

without a need for boring scrolling. 

----

Background: To do all of this I had to dig very deep into VB IDEs COM interface and so here is hard stuff like 'Get a reference to the control under the mouse' and more ... 

----

Enjoy the new feeling in programming VB!

NEW VERSION 2.5.0 - 10/20/2004: Now your code is flying, too! I have added a powerfull TEXT AUTOCOMPLETE feature to speedup your coding. Please read ReadMe_First.Txt or code header for details.

Thx for your comments and votes - they show me that you see the 160 hours which are in this tool now.
